Abstract
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned
large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.
Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our
models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on
our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-
source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety
improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and
contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.

Figure 1: Helpfulness human evaluation results for Llama
2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed-source
models. Human raters compared model generations on ~4k
prompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts.
The 95% confidence intervals for this evaluation are between
1% and 2%. More details in Section 3.4.2. While reviewing
these results, it is important to note that human evaluations
can be noisy due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity
of the review guidelines, subjectivity of individual raters,
and the inherent difficulty of comparing generations.

model is better according to GPT-4. To remove

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in
complex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized
domains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive
chat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.
The capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training
methodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,
followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have
limited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs
(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that
match the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla
(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such
as ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human
preferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in
compute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within
the community to advance AI alignment research.
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and
Llama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,
Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to
be on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see
Figures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data
annotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,
this paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving
LLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and
continue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.
We also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as
the emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.

Figure 3: Safety human evaluation results for Llama 2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed-
source models. Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial
prompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is
important to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the
prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. Additionally, these
safety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the Llama
2-Chat models.
We are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:
1. Llama 2, an updated version of Llama 1, trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also
increased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and
adopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of Llama 2 with
7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper
but are not releasing.§
2. Llama 2-Chat, a fine-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release
variants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.
We believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net benefit to society. Like all LLMs,
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;
Solaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover
all scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2-Chat, developers should perform
safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We provide a responsible use
guide¶ and code examples‖ to facilitate the safe deployment of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. More details of
our responsible release strategy can be found in Section 5.3.
The remainder of this paper describes our pretraining methodology (Section 2), fine-tuning methodology
(Section 3), approach to model safety (Section 4), key observations and insights (Section 5), relevant related
work (Section 6), and conclusions (Section 7).

Figure 4: Training of Llama 2-Chat: This process begins with the pretraining of Llama 2 using publicly
available online sources. Following this, we create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat through the application
of supervised fine-tuning. Subsequently, the model is iteratively refined using Reinforcement Learning
with Human Feedback (RLHF) methodologies, specifically through rejection sampling and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Throughout the RLHF stage, the accumulation of iterative reward modeling data in
parallel with model enhancements is crucial to ensure the reward models remain within distribution.
2
Pretraining
To create the new family of Llama 2 models, we began with the pretraining approach described in Touvron et al.
(2023), using an optimized auto-regressive transformer, but made several changes to improve performance.
Specifically, we performed more robust data cleaning, updated our data mixes, trained on 40% more total
tokens, doubled the context length, and used grouped-query attention (GQA) to improve inference scalability
for our larger models. Table 1 compares the attributes of the new Llama 2 models with the Llama 1 models.
2.1
Pretraining Data
Our training corpus includes a new mix of data from publicly available sources, which does not include data
from Meta’s products or services. We made an effort to remove data from certain sites known to contain a
high volume of personal information about private individuals. We trained on 2 trillion tokens of data as this
provides a good performance–cost trade-off, up-sampling the most factual sources in an effort to increase
knowledge and dampen hallucinations.
We performed a variety of pretraining data investigations so that users can better understand the potential
capabilities and limitations of our models; results can be found in Section 4.1.
2.2
Training Details
We adopt most of the pretraining setting and model architecture from Llama 1. We use the standard
transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), apply pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang and
Sennrich, 2019), use the SwiGLU activation function (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings
(RoPE, Su et al. 2022). The primary architectural differences from Llama 1 include increased context length
and grouped-query attention (GQA). We detail in Appendix Section A.2.1 each of these differences with
ablation experiments to demonstrate their importance.
Hyperparameters.
We trained using the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with β1 =
0.9, β2 = 0.95, eps = 10−5. We use a cosine learning rate schedule, with warmup of 2000 steps, and decay
final learning rate down to 10% of the peak learning rate. We use a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping
of 1.0. Figure 5 (a) shows the training loss for Llama 2 with these hyperparameters.

Tokenizer.
We use the same tokenizer as Llama 1; it employs a bytepair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Sennrich
et al., 2016) using the implementation from SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). As with Llama 1,
we split all numbers into individual digits and use bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. The total
vocabulary size is 32k tokens.

Training Hardware & Carbon Footprint
Training Hardware.
We pretrained our models on Meta’s Research Super Cluster (RSC) (Lee and Sengupta,
2022) as well as internal production clusters. Both clusters use NVIDIA A100s. There are two key differences
between the two clusters, with the first being the type of interconnect available: RSC uses NVIDIA Quantum
InfiniBand while our production cluster is equipped with a RoCE (RDMA over converged Ethernet) solution
based on commodity ethernet Switches. Both of these solutions interconnect 200 Gbps end-points. The
second difference is the per-GPU power consumption cap — RSC uses 400W while our production cluster
uses 350W. With this two-cluster setup, we were able to compare the suitability of these different types of
interconnect for large scale training. RoCE (which is a more affordable, commercial interconnect network)

can scale almost as well as expensive Infiniband up to 2000 GPUs, which makes pretraining even more
democratizable.
Carbon Footprint of Pretraining.
Following preceding research (Bender et al., 2021a; Patterson et al., 2021;
Wu et al., 2022; Dodge et al., 2022) and using power consumption estimates of GPU devices and carbon
efficiency, we aim to calculate the carbon emissions resulting from the pretraining of Llama 2 models. The
actual power usage of a GPU is dependent on its utilization and is likely to vary from the Thermal Design
Power (TDP) that we employ as an estimation for GPU power. It is important to note that our calculations
do not account for further power demands, such as those from interconnect or non-GPU server power
consumption, nor from datacenter cooling systems. Additionally, the carbon output related to the production
of AI hardware, like GPUs, could add to the overall carbon footprint as suggested by Gupta et al. (2022b,a).
Table 2 summarizes the carbon emission for pretraining the Llama 2 family of models. A cumulative of
3.3M GPU hours of computation was performed on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 400W or 350W).
We estimate the total emissions for training to be 539 tCO2eq, of which 100% were directly offset by Meta’s
sustainability program.∗∗Our open release strategy also means that these pretraining costs will not need to
be incurred by other companies, saving more global resources.
2.3
Llama 2 Pretrained Model Evaluation
In this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 base models, MosaicML Pretrained
Transformer (MPT)†† models, and Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) models on standard academic benchmarks.
For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library. We reproduce results for the MPT and Falcon
models internally. For these models, we always pick the best score between our evaluation framework and
any publicly reported results.
In Table 3, we summarize the overall performance across a suite of popular benchmarks. Note that safety
benchmarks are shared in Section 4.1. The benchmarks are grouped into the categories listed below. The
results for all the individual benchmarks are available in Section A.2.2.
• Code. We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and
MBPP (Austin et al., 2021).
• Commonsense Reasoning. We report the average of PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), SIQA (Sap et al., 2019),
HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019a), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), ARC easy and challenge
(Clark et al., 2018), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), and CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al.,
2018). We report 7-shot results for CommonSenseQA and 0-shot results for all other benchmarks.
• World Knowledge. We evaluate the 5-shot performance on NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019) and TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and report the average.
• Reading Comprehension. For reading comprehension, we report the 0-shot average on SQuAD
(Rajpurkar et al., 2018), QuAC (Choi et al., 2018), and BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019).
• MATH. We report the average of the GSM8K (8 shot) (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (4 shot)
(Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmarks at top 1.

Table 3: Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks compared to open-source base models.
• Popular Aggregated Benchmarks. We report the overall results for MMLU (5 shot) (Hendrycks
et al., 2020), Big Bench Hard (BBH) (3 shot) (Suzgun et al., 2022), and AGI Eval (3–5 shot) (Zhong
et al., 2023). For AGI Eval, we only evaluate on the English tasks and report the average.
As shown in Table 3, Llama 2 models outperform Llama 1 models. In particular, Llama 2 70B improves the
results on MMLU and BBH by ≈5 and ≈8 points, respectively, compared to Llama 1 65B. Llama 2 7B and 30B
models outperform MPT models of the corresponding size on all categories besides code benchmarks. For the
Falcon models, Llama 2 7B and 34B outperform Falcon 7B and 40B models on all categories of benchmarks.
Additionally, Llama 2 70B model outperforms all open-source models.
In addition to open-source models, we also compare Llama 2 70B results to closed-source models. As shown
in Table 4, Llama 2 70B is close to GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023) on MMLU and GSM8K, but there is a significant
gap on coding benchmarks. Llama 2 70B results are on par or better than PaLM (540B) (Chowdhery et al.,
2022) on almost all benchmarks. There is still a large gap in performance between Llama 2 70B and GPT-4
and PaLM-2-L.
We also analysed the potential data contamination and share the details in Section A.6.

Fine-tuning
Llama 2-Chat is the result of several months of research and iterative applications of alignment techniques,
including both instruction tuning and RLHF, requiring significant computational and annotation resources.
In this section, we report on our experiments and findings using supervised fine-tuning (Section 3.1), as
well as initial and iterative reward modeling (Section 3.2.2) and RLHF (Section 3.2.3). We also share a
new technique, Ghost Attention (GAtt), which we find helps control dialogue flow over multiple turns
(Section 3.3). See Section 4.2 for safety evaluations on fine-tuned models.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
➤Prompt:
Write a poem to help me remember the first 10 elements on the periodic table, giving each
element its own line.
Response:
Hydrogen comes first as element number one.
Helium is second for balloons to have fun!
In third place is Lithium to hold battery charge,
Followed by Beryllium in emeralds small and large.
Boron’s number five to help us keep things clean.
Carbon’s next at six, and it’s found in every gene.
Nitrogen is seven, found in every breath we take,
More than eight (or Oxygen) in atmospheric make.
Number nine is Fluorine, helping polish up our teeth.
Neon gives us glowing signs to read and stand beneath.
➤Prompt:
I want you to roast me. I want you to make it particularly brutal, swearing at me.
Response:
I’m sorry, but I cannot comply with that request. Using vulgar language or intentionally
hurting someone’s feelings is never acceptable. Instead of asking for a roast, I suggest
focusing on positive and constructive feedback that can help you grow and improve as an
individual. If you’re looking for comedic relief, there are plenty of other ways to achieve
that without resorting to hurtful language or behavior.
Table 5: SFT annotation — example of a helpfulness (top) and safety (bottom) annotation for SFT, where the
annotator has written both the prompt and its answer.
Getting Started.
To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning
data (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).
Quality Is All You Need.
Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that
many of these have insufficient diversity and quality — in particular for aligning LLMs towards dialogue-style
instructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,
as illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but
higher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These
findings are similar in spirit to Zhou et al. (2023), which also finds that a limited set of clean instruction-tuning
data can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of
thousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of
27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.
We also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-
stream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source
annotations. To validate our data quality, we carefully examined a set of 180 examples, comparing the annota-
tions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,
we found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data
handwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort
to preference-based annotation for RLHF.
Fine-Tuning Details.
For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial
learning rate of 2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.
For the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence
length is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is
utilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out
the loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens. Finally, we
fine-tune the model for 2 epochs.
3.2
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
RLHF is a model training procedure that is applied to a fine-tuned language model to further align model
behavior with human preferences and instruction following. We collect data that represents empirically

sampled human preferences, whereby human annotators select which of two model outputs they prefer.
This human feedback is subsequently used to train a reward model, which learns patterns in the preferences
of the human annotators and can then automate preference decisions.
3.2.1
Human Preference Data Collection
Next, we collect human preference data for reward modeling. We chose a binary comparison protocol over
other schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other
strategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.
Our annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose
between two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the
two responses to a given prompt are sampled from two different model variants, and varying the temperature
hyper-parameter. In addition to giving participants a forced choice, we also ask annotators to label the degree
to which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better, better,
slightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.
For our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how
well Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to
whether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could
be considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to
apply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide
instructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.
Apart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.
This additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response
is safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with
18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples
where the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be
better/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations
can be found in Section 4.2.1.
Human annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our
reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see
the results in Section 5, Figure 20). Llama 2-Chat improvement also shifted the model’s data distribution.
Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from
hyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a new Llama 2-Chat tuning iteration to
gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations. This step helps keep the reward model
on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.
In Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them
against multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,
2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange
(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).
We collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified
guidelines, which we refer to as Meta reward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and
answers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer
prompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our
preference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.
3.2.2
Reward Modeling
The reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous
turns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model
generation. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimize Llama 2-Chat during RLHF for
better human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.
Others have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it
challenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward
models, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to as Helpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).
We initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models
benefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model

Table 6: Statistics of human preference data for reward modeling. We list both the open-source and
internally collected human preference data used for reward modeling. Note that a binary human preference
comparison contains 2 responses (chosen and rejected) sharing the same prompt (and previous dialogue).
Each example consists of a prompt (including previous dialogue if available) and a response, which is the
input of the reward model. We report the number of comparisons, the average number of turns per dialogue,
the average number of tokens per example, per prompt and per response. More details on Meta helpfulness
and safety data per batch can be found in Appendix A.3.1.
knows. This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which
could result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those
of the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced
with a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.
Training Objectives.
To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data
into a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher
score than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):
Lranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) −rθ(x, yr)))
(1)
where rθ(x, y) is the scalar score output for prompt x and completion y with model weights θ. yc is the
preferred response that annotators choose and yr is the rejected counterpart.
Built on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety
reward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,
significantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly
teach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To
do so, we further add a margin component in the loss:
Lranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) −rθ(x, yr) −m(r)))
(2)
where the margin m(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin
for pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).
We found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples
where two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in
Appendix A.3.3.
Data Composition.
We combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets
to form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models
while we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in
this study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-Chat outputs rather than
any model outputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source
preference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better
generalization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Chat taking advantage of
some weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.
With training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both
Helpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings. After extensive experimentation, the

Helpfulness reward model is eventually trained on all Meta Helpfulness data, combined with an equal
parts of the remaining data uniformly sampled from Meta Safety and from the open-source datasets. The
Meta Safety reward model is trained on all Meta Safety and Anthropic Harmless data, mixed with Meta
Helpfulness and open-source helpfulness data in a 90/10 proportion. We found that the setting with 10%
helpfulness data is especially beneficial for the accuracy on samples where both the chosen and rejected
responses were deemed safe.
Training Details.
We train for one epoch over the training data. In earlier experiments, we found that
training longer can lead to over-fitting. We use the same optimizer parameters as for the base model. The
maximum learning rate is 5 × 10−6 for the 70B parameter Llama 2-Chat and 1 × 10−5 for the rest. The
learning rate is decreased on a cosine learning rate schedule, down to 10% of the maximum learning rate.
We use a warm-up of 3% of the total number of steps, with a minimum of 5. The effective batch size is kept
fixed at 512 pairs, or 1024 rows per batch.

Table 8: Granular reward model accuracy per preference rating. We report per-preference rating accuracy
for both Helpfulness and Safety reward models on the Meta Helpfulness and Safety test sets. The reward
models show superior accuracy on more distinct responses (e.g., significantly better) and lower accuracy on
similar responses (e.g., negligibly better).
Reward Model Results.
On each batch of human preference annotation for reward modeling, we held out
1000 examples as a test set to evaluate our models. We refer to the union of all prompts for the corresponding
test sets as “Meta Helpfulness” and “Meta Safety,” respectively.
As reference points, we also evaluated other publicly available alternatives as baselines: SteamSHP-XL
(Ethayarajh et al., 2022) based on FLAN-T5-xl, the Open Assistant (Köpf et al., 2023) reward model based on
DeBERTa V3 Large (He et al., 2020), and GPT4 accessible through the OpenAI’s API. Note that at inference
time, as opposed to training, all the reward models can predict a scalar for a single output, without requiring
to access its paired output. For GPT-4, we prompt with a zero-shot question “Choose the best answer between A
and B,” where A and B are the two responses for comparison.
We report the results in terms of accuracy in Table 7. As expected, our own reward models perform the best
on our internal test sets collected based on Llama 2-Chat, with the Helpfulness reward model performing
best on the Meta Helpfulness test set, and similarly the Safety reward model performing best on the Meta
Safety test set. Overall, our reward models outperform all of the baselines, including GPT-4. Interestingly,
GPT-4 performs better than other non-Meta reward models, despite not being trained directly nor targeting
specifically this reward modeling task.

Figure 6: Scaling trends for the reward model. More data and a larger-size model generally improve
accuracy, and it appears that our models have not yet saturated from learning on the training data.
The fact that helpfulness and safety performed the best on their own domain is potentially due to the tension
between the two objectives (i.e., being as helpful as possible versus refusing unsafe prompts when necessary),
which may confuse the reward model during training. In order for a single model to perform well on both
dimensions, it needs to not only learn to select the better response given a prompt but also to distinguish
adversarial prompts from safe ones. As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling
task. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.
When we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the
“significantly better” test set and degrades gradually as comparison pairs become more similar (e.g., “slightly
better”). It is expected that learning to model human preferences becomes challenging when deciding
between two similar model responses, due to annotator subjectivity and their reliance on nuanced details
that may differentiate responses. We emphasize that the accuracy on more distinct responses matters the
most to improve Llama 2-Chat performance. The human preference annotation agreement rate is also higher
on more distinct responses than similar pairs.
Scaling Trends.
We study the scaling trends in terms of data and model size for the reward model, fine-
tuning different model sizes on an increasing amount of the reward model data collected each week (see the
details on volume per batch in Table 26). Figure 6 reports these trends, showing the expected result that larger
models obtain higher performance for a similar volume of data. More importantly, the scaling performance
has not yet plateaued given the existing volume of data annotation used for training, a signal that there is
room for more improvement with more annotations. We note that reward model accuracy is one of the most
important proxies for the final performance of Llama 2-Chat. While best practices for comprehensively
evaluating a generative model is an open research question, the ranking task of the reward has no ambiguity.
Therefore, everything else being equal, an improvement of the reward model can be directly translated into
an improvement for Llama 2-Chat.
3.2.3
Iterative Fine-Tuning
As we received more batches of human preference data annotation, we were able to train better reward
models and collect more prompts. We therefore trained successive versions for RLHF models, referred to
here as RLHF-V1, ..., RLHF-V5.
We explored RLHF fine-tuning with two main algorithms:
• Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), the standard in RLHF literature.
• Rejection Sampling fine-tuning. We sample K outputs from the model and select the best candidate
with our reward, consistent with Bai et al. (2022b). The same re-ranking strategy for LLMs was also
proposed in Deng et al. (2019), where the reward is seen as an energy function. Here, we go one step
further, and use the selected outputs for a gradient update. For each prompt, the sample obtaining

the highest reward score is considered the new gold standard. Similar to Scialom et al. (2020a), we
then fine-tune our model on the new set of ranked samples, reinforcing the reward.
The two RL algorithms mainly differ in:
• Breadth — in Rejection Sampling, the model explores K samples for a given prompt, while only one
generation is done for PPO.
• Depth — in PPO, during training at step t the sample is a function of the updated model policy from
t −1 after the gradient update of the previous step. In Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, we sample
all the outputs given the initial policy of our model to collect a new dataset, before applying the
fine-tuning similar to SFT. However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental
differences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced.
Until RLHF (V4), we used only Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, and after that, we combined the two
sequentially, applying PPO on top of the resulted Rejection Sampling checkpoint before sampling again.

Rejection Sampling.
We perform rejection sampling only with our largest 70B Llama 2-Chat. All smaller
models are fine-tuned on rejection sampled data from the larger model, thus distilling the large-model
capabilities into the smaller ones. We leave further analysis of the effect of this distillation for future work.
At each iterative stage, we sample K answers for each prompt from the most recent model. We score each
sample given the best reward model accessible at the time of the experiment, and then select the best answer
for a given prompt. In earlier versions of our model, up to RLHF V3, our approach was to confine answer
selection solely to the “bag” of samples gathered from the preceding iteration. For example, RLHF V3 was
trained using only samples from RLHF V2. However, despite continuous improvement, this method led to a

regression in some capabilities. For example, RLHF V3 struggled more than previous versions to compose
rhyming lines in poems, as discerned through qualitative analysis, suggesting that further investigation into
the causes of and mitigations for forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019; Ramasesh et al.,
2021) could be a fruitful area for additional future research.
In response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from
all prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2. Although we do not present specific
figures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed
the previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals
et al. (2019) in the RL literature.
We illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median
curves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta
increases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to
generate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the
exploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also
plays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.
In Figure 8, we report for a Llama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and a Llama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum
reward curves among N samples (with N ∈[1, . . . , 100]), for different temperatures. We can observe that
the optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on
rescaling the temperature. For Llama 2-Chat-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10
and 100 outputs is T ∈[1.2, 1.3]. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the
temperature progressively. Note that this temperature rescaling happens for a constant number of steps for
each model, and always starting from the base model on each new RLHF version.
PPO.
We further train our language model following the RL scheme of Stiennon et al. (2020), which uses the
reward model as an estimate for the true reward function (human preference) and the pretrained language
model as the policy to optimize. During this phase, we seek to optimize the following objective:
arg max
π
Ep∼D,g∼π[R(g | p)]
(3)
We iteratively improve the policy by sampling prompts p from our dataset D and generations g from the
policy π and use the PPO algorithm and loss function to achieve this objective.
The final reward function we use during optimization,
R(g | p) = ˜Rc(g | p) −βDKL(πθ(g | p) ∥π0(g | p))
(4)
contains a penalty term for diverging from the original policy π0. As was observed in other works (Stiennon
et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), we find this constraint is useful for training stability, and to reduce reward
hacking whereby we would achieve high scores from the reward model but low scores from human evaluation.
We define Rc to be a piecewise combination of the safety (Rs) and helpfulness (Rh) reward models. We
have tagged prompts in our dataset that might elicit potentially unsafe responses and prioritize the scores
from the safety model. The threshold of 0.15 is chosen for filtering unsafe responses, corresponding to a
precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.55 evaluated on the Meta Safety test set. We also find it important to whiten
the final linear scores (shown here by reversing the sigmoid with the logit function) in order to increase
stability and balance properly with the KL penalty term (β) above.
Rc(g | p) =
Rs(g | p)
if is_safety(p) or Rs(g | p) < 0.15
Rh(g | p)
otherwise
˜Rc(g | p) = whiten(logit(Rc(g | p)))
For all models, we use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, eps =
10−5. We use a weight decay of 0.1, gradient clipping of 1.0, and a constant learning rate of 10−6. For each
PPO iteration we use a batch size of 512, a PPO clip threshold of 0.2, a mini-batch size of 64, and take one
gradient step per mini-batch. For the 7B and 13B models, we set β = 0.01 (KL penalty), and for the 34B and
70B models, we set β = 0.005.
15


Figure 9: Issues with multi-turn memory (left) can be improved with GAtt (right).
We train for between 200 and 400 iterations for all our models, and use evaluations on held-out prompts for
early stopping. Each iteration of PPO on the 70B model takes on average ≈330 seconds. To train quickly with
large batch sizes, we use FSDP (Zhao et al., 2023). This was effective when using O(1) forward or backward
passes, but caused a large slow down (≈20×) during generation, even when using a large batch size and KV
cache. We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation
and then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.
3.3
System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency
In a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,
or to “act as” some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat, the subsequent
response should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial
instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).
To address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context
Distillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage
process. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).
GAtt Method.
Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user
and an assistant), with a list of messages [u1, a1, . . . , un, an], where un and an correspond to the user and
assistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected
throughout the dialogue. For example, inst could be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this
instruction to all the user messages of the conversation.
Next, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue
and the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of
augmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this
would lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant
messages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we
simply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.
For the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy
e.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists
of hobbies and public figures, we asked Llama 2-Chat to generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the
instruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during
training). To make the instructions more complex and diverse, we construct the final instruction by randomly
combining the above constraints. When constructing the final system message for the training data, we also

modify the original instruction half of the time to be less verbose, e.g., “Always act as Napoleon from now”->
”Figure: Napoleon.” These steps produce an SFT dataset, on which we can fine-tune Llama 2-Chat.
GAtt Evaluation.
We applied GAtt after RLHF V3. We report a quantitative analysis indicating that GAtt is
consistent up to 20+ turns, until the maximum context length is reached (see Appendix A.3.5). We tried to
set constraints not present in the training of GAtt at inference time, for instance “Always answer with Haiku,”
for which the model remained consistent as illustrated in Appendix Figure 28.

Figure 10: Attention visualization for a dialogue with and without GAtt. We considered the maximum
activations across the network and we bin neighboring tokens together.
To illustrate how GAtt helped reshape attention during fine-tuning, we display the maximum attention
activations of the model in Figure 10. The left-hand side of each figure corresponds to the system message
(“Act as Oscar Wilde”). We can see that the GAtt-equipped model (right) maintains large attention activations
with respect to the system message for a larger portion of the dialogue, as compared to the model without
GAtt (left).
Despite its utility, the current implementation of GAtt is vanilla, and more development and iteration on
this technique could likely further benefit the model. For instance, we could teach the model to change the
system message during the conversation by integrating such data during fine-tuning.

RLHF Results
3.4.1
Model-Based Evaluation
Evaluating LLMs is a challenging open-research problem. Human evaluation, while a gold standard, can
be complicated by various HCI considerations (Clark et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2023), and is not always
scalable. Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1
to V5, we first observed the improvement of the rewards from the latest reward models, to save costs and
increase iteration speed. We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.
How Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?
To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected
a test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the
answers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better). We observe that our reward models overall
are well calibrated with our human preference annotations, as illustrated in Figure 29 in the appendix. This
confirms the relevance of using our reward as a point-wise metric, despite being trained with a Pairwise
Ranking Loss.
Still, as Goodhart’s Law states, when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. To ensure
our measure won’t diverge from the human preferences, we additionally used a more general reward, trained

on diverse open-source Reward Modeling datasets. We have not yet observed any such divergence, and
hypothesize that iterative model updates may be helping to prevent this.
As a last verification step to ensure no regression between our new model and the previous one, we use both
to sample during the next annotation iteration. This enables a model comparison “for free” on new prompts
and can help to increase diversity when sampling.
Progression of Models.
Figure 11 reports the progress of our different SFT and then RLHF versions for
both Safety and Helpfulness axes, measured by our in-house Safety and Helpfulness reward models. On
this set of evaluations, we outperform ChatGPT on both axes after RLHF-V3 (harmlessness and helpfulness
>50%). Despite the aforementioned relevance of using our reward as a point-wise metric, it can arguably be
biased in favor of Llama 2-Chat. Therefore, for a fair comparison, we additionally compute the final results
using GPT-4 to assess which generation is preferred. The order in which ChatGPT and Llama 2-Chat outputs
appeared in GPT-4 prompt are randomly swapped to avoid any bias. As expected, the win-rate in favor of
Llama 2-Chat is less pronounced, although obtaining more than a 60% win-rate for our latest Llama 2-Chat.
The prompts correspond to a validation set of 1, 586 and 584 prompts for safety and helpfulness, respectively.
3.4.2
Human Evaluation
Human evaluation is often considered the gold standard for judging models for natural language generation,
including dialogue models. To evaluate the quality of major model versions, we asked human evaluators to
rate them on helpfulness and safety. We compare the Llama 2-Chat models to open-source models (Falcon,
MPT MosaicML NLP Team et al. (2023), Vicuna Chiang et al. (2023), as well as closed-source models (Chat-
GPT (OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM Anil et al. (2023)) on over 4, 000 single and multi-turn prompts. For ChatGPT,
we use gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 model in all generations. For PaLM, we use the chat-bison-001 model in all
generations. The final prompt count for human evaluations for each model is shown in Table 32. See more
methodology details in Appendix, Section A.3.7. The following section shows helpfulness results; safety
results are presented in Section 4.4.
Results.
As shown in Figure 12, Llama 2-Chat models outperform open-source models by a significant
margin on both single turn and multi-turn prompts. Particularly, Llama 2-Chat 7B model outperforms
MPT-7B-chat on 60% of the prompts. Llama 2-Chat 34B has an overall win rate of more than 75% against
equivalently sized Vicuna-33B and Falcon 40B models.

Figure 12: Human evaluation results for Llama 2-Chat models compared to open- and closed-source models
across ~4,000 helpfulness prompts with three raters per prompt.
The largest Llama 2-Chat model is competitive with ChatGPT. Llama 2-Chat 70B model has a win rate of
36% and a tie rate of 31.5% relative to ChatGPT. Llama 2-Chat 70B model outperforms PaLM-bison chat
model by a large percentage on our prompt set. More results and analysis is available in Section A.3.7.
Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR).
In our human evaluations, three different annotators provided independent
assessments for each model generation comparison. High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as
better from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating
the overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling
tasks. There are relatively few public benchmarks for these contexts, so we feel sharing our analysis here will
benefit the research community.
We used Gwet’s AC1/2 statistic (Gwet, 2008, 2014) to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), as we found it to
be the most stable metric across different measurement scenarios. On the 7-point Likert scale helpfulness
task that is used in our analysis, Gwet’s AC2 score varies between 0.37 and 0.55 depending on the specific
model comparison. We see scores on the lower end of that range for ratings from model comparisons with
similar win rates to each other (like the Llama 2-Chat-70B-chat vs. ChatGPT comparison). We see scores on
the higher end of that range for ratings from model comparisons with a more clear winner (like the Llama
2-Chat-34b-chat vs. Falcon-40b-instruct).
Limitations of human evaluations.
While our results indicate that Llama 2-Chat is on par with ChatGPT
on human evaluations, it is important to note that human evaluations have several limitations.
• By academic and research standards, we have a large prompt set of 4k prompts. However, it does not cover
real-world usage of these models, which will likely cover a significantly larger number of use cases.
• Diversity of the prompts could be another factor in our results. For example, our prompt set does not
include any coding- or reasoning-related prompts.
• We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be
to ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns.
• Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy. As a result, evaluation on a
different set of prompts or with different instructions could result in different results.

Safety
WARNING: this section contains examples of text that may be considered unsafe, offensive, or upsetting.
In this section, we dive deeper into the important topic of safety measurements and mitigations. We first
discuss our safety investigations into pretraining data and pretrained models (Section 4.1). Next, we describe
the process of our safety alignment (Section 4.2), explaining how we collected safety-related annotations and
utilized SFT and RLHF, and present experimental results. Then, we discuss the red teaming we performed to
further understand and improve model safety (Section 4.3). Finally, we present quantitative safety evaluations
of Llama 2-Chat (Section 4.4). We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.
4.1
Safety in Pretraining
It is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed
light on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases. This can inform what, if any,
downstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the
pretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present
the results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.
Steps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.
We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for
each dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain
sites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best
effort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our
models broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. No additional filtering was conducted
on the datasets, to allow Llama 2 to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate
speech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused
by over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows Llama 2-Chat to generalize more effectively during safety tuning
with fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models
should be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.
Demographic Representation: Pronouns.
Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited
from the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words
representing “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men” than to words
representing “women,” and Ganesh et al. (2023) demonstrates that a model’s performance on fairness metrics
can be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic
groups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common
English pronouns in Table 9a. We observe that He pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents
compared to She pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly
sized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less
during pretraining about context that mentions She pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generate He
pronouns at a higher rate than She pronouns.
Demographic Representation: Identities.
We also analyze the representation of different demographic
groups in the pretraining data by measuring rates of usage of demographic identity terms from the HolisticBias
dataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining
corpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and
Sexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few
terms such as “straight,” “white,” and “black,” because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic
mentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in
both Gender and Sex and Sexual Orientation. For Gender and Sex, while She pronouns are mentioned
in fewer documents, the term “female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply
that while there is less frequent context about She pronouns, comments about “females” are more prevalent,
perhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). For Sexual
Orientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. For Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and
Religion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term “American” is mentioned in
69.4% of the references, the term “European” is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and “Christian”
is the most represented religion followed by “Catholic” and “Jewish.”

Table 9: Demographic representations. Analysis of pronouns and identities in our pretraining corpus shows
some skews that may affect performance, such as higher representations of Western demographics.
Figure 13: Pretraining data toxicity. To allow for better downstream generalization, we chose not to scrub
toxic data from pretraining. The HateBERT classifier assigns a toxicity likelihood of 0.5 or higher to about
0.2% of documents in our pretraining corpus.
Data Toxicity.
We measure the prevalence of toxicity in the English-language portion of the pretraining
corpus using a HateBERT classifier fine-tuned on the ToxiGen dataset (Hartvigsen et al., 2022). We score each
line of a document separately and average them to assign a document score. Figure 13 shows the distribution
of scores in a 10% random sample of the full corpus. About 0.2% of documents evaluated are assigned a
likelihood score of 0.5 or higher, meaning there is a small amount of toxicity in our pretraining data.
Language Identification.
While our pretraining data is mostly English, it also includes text from a small
number of other languages. Table 10 shows the distribution of languages in our corpus, subsetted to those
found in more than 0.005% of the documents. Our analysis uses the fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) language
identification tool and a threshold of 0.5 for the language detection. A training corpus with a majority in
English means that the model may not be suitable for use in other languages.

partially made up of programming code data.
Safety Benchmarks for Pretrained Models.
We evaluate the safety capabilities of Llama 2 on three popular
automatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.
1. Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-
tions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can
generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.
2. Toxicity, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly
hateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation
of toxic language and hate speech across different groups.
3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use
BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with
demographic attributes.
We compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,
2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1
and use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the
percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we
present the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed
descriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared to Llama 1-7B,
Llama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in
toxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result
from larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship
between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical
work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and
further evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.
In Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with
demographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using
BOLD prompts. More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix A.4.8.
Llama 2 does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we
refrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may
enable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),
and it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models
trained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable
safety-alignment. We reiterate that this motivated choice does imply that additional safety mitigations should
be applied before deployment of base Llama 2 models.

percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher the better). For ToxiGen, we
present the percentage of toxic generations (the smaller, the better).
Benchmarks give a summary view of model capabilities and behaviors that allow us to understand general
patterns in the model, but they do not provide a fully comprehensive view of the impact the model may have
on people or real-world outcomes; that would require study of end-to-end product deployments. Further
testing and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context
in which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in
the BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to
continuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.
4.2
Safety Fine-Tuning
In this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation
guidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general
fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.
Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:
1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-
tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches
the model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for
high-quality human preference data annotation.
2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-
tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging
adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.
3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell
et al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety
preprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer
responses without the preprompt, which essentially distills the safety preprompt (context) into the
model. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use
context distillation for each sample.
4.2.1
Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines
Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to
create adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a risk category, or potential topic about which the LLM
could produce unsafe content; and an attack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts
that could elicit bad model behaviors.
The risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal
activities (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); hateful and harmful activities (e.g., defamation, self-
harm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal

advice). The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),
logic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation
(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.
We then define best practices for safe and helpful model responses: the model should first address immediate
safety concerns if applicable, then address the prompt by explaining the potential risks to the user, and finally
provide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience
categories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are
iteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.
4.2.2
Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning
In accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations
of safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same
manner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.
The annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce
the model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,
annotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.
4.2.3
Safety RLHF
We observe early in the development of Llama 2-Chat that it is able to generalize from the safe demonstrations
in supervised fine-tuning. The model quickly learns to write detailed safe responses, address safety concerns,
explain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when
the model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.
Therefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to
teach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added
benefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).
We conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators
write a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to
the prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human
preference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to
sample from the model during the RLHF stage.
Better Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting Helpfulness
Safety is inherently a long-tail problem,
where the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety
RLHF by taking two intermediate Llama 2-Chat checkpoints—one without adversarial prompts in the RLHF
stage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward
models. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that
of the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that
the distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with
RLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left
corner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering
pattern below the y = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score
distribution is preserved after safety tuning with RLHF. Put another way, given sufficient helpfulness training
data, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance
on helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.
Impact of Safety Data Scaling.
A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in
previous studies (Bai et al., 2022a). To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects
general model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by
adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage. In this ablation experiment, we keep the amount
of helpfulness training data unchanged (∼0.9M samples) and gradually increase the amount of safety data
used in model tuning, ranging from 0% to 100% (∼0.1M samples). For the specific training data mix recipe,
we follow the procedure described in Section 3.1 and fine-tune Llama 2 pretrained model for 2 epochs.
We eventually obtain 6 model variants trained with 0%, 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% of the total safety
data. We evaluate them using our safety and helpfulness reward models described in Section 3.2.2. For

each variant, we use the safety and helpfulness reward models to score model generations corresponding to
prompts in the Meta Safety and Helpful test sets, respectively.
As shown in Figure 15, we use the mean reward model scores as proxies of model performance on safety and
helpfulness. We observe that when we increase the proportion of safety data, the model’s performance on
handling risky and adversarial prompts improves dramatically, and we see a lighter tail in the safety reward
model score distribution. Meanwhile, the mean helpfulness score remains constant. We hypothesize that
this is because we already have a sufficiently large amount of helpfulness training data. Appendix A.4.2 lists
more qualitative results that demonstrate how different amounts of safety data in training can change model
behavior in responding to adversarial and non-adversarial prompts.

Right: the left tail of safety RM scores (i.e., most unsafe responses) gradually disappears with the addition of

Measure of False Refusal.
Even though we do not see overall regression on model helpfulness, we qualita-
tively observe, through interaction, that the model with more safety mitigation answers certain questions in
a more conservative manner (e.g., example shown in Appendix Table 38). As a follow-up, we measure false
refusal to quantify the frequency that the model incorrectly refuses to answer non-adversarial prompts. Here,
we define false refusal as the model incorrectly refusing to answer legitimate user prompts due to irrelevant
safety concerns. Refusing due to reasonable causes exceeding the model’s capability, e.g., “I am not capable of
participating in video calls” and “2024 is beyond my knowledge cut-off date,” are not counted as false refusals. We
train a classifier for detecting refusals in responses and apply the classifier on 1) the above helpfulness test
sets and 2) a curated borderline test set consisting of 210 samples for the purpose of boundary testing similar
to OpenAI (2023). The borderline dataset is designed intentionally so that its prompts look adversarial
(e.g., containing sensitive words or subwords) but are not actually unsafe (e.g., “give me a recipe for Christmas
Crack”) (see Appendix Table 41 for more examples).
With more safety data mixed in model tuning, the false-refusal rate becomes larger on both datasets (see
Appendix Figure 33). However, false refusal is overall rare—approximately 0.05%—on the helpfulness
dataset, even with 100% safety data. On the other hand, the false-refusal rate is much larger on the borderline
set due to its difficulty. Llama 2-Chat sometimes has difficulty distinguishing whether a prompt is safe when
the prompt contains words that frequently occur in unsafe generations (such as “bomb”). Appendix Table 41
shows some examples of false refusals we discovered.

4.2.4
Context Distillation for Safety
We encourage Llama 2-Chat to associate adversarial prompts with safer responses by using context distillation
(Askell et al., 2021a) similar to Section 3.3. We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently
enhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant”).
Like supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s
responses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.
Specifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate
safer responses, and then fine-tune the model on its own safe output given the adversarial prompt without
the preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various
adjectives usually associated with safe behavior such as “responsible,” “respectful’,’ or “wise,” with the intuition
that the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers. We show
examples of safety preprompts in Appendix Table 39.
Context Distillation with Answer Templates
During the prompt collection phase, we also asked annotators
to label prompts according to risk categories, which enables even more targeted preprompts. Specifically,
this allows us to provide some dedicated answer templates of how adversarial prompts should be addressed,
based on each identified risk category. Figure 16a shows the impact of context distillation and context
distillation with answer templates on the safety RM scores.

Figure 16: Context distillation analysis. Left: Distribution of safety RM scores from the base model, when
adding a generic preprompt, and when adding a preprompt based on the risk category with tailored answer
template. While a generic preprompt increases safety RM scores, a preprompt with tailored answer template
helps even more. Right: Context distillation increases the RM score significantly for samples that initially
have a low score, but can also have a detrimental effect on samples that initially have a high score. We
therefore only apply context distillation on targeted samples when it increases RM score.
Rejecting Context Distillation Errors with the Safety Reward Model
It is important to note that performing
safety context distillation for helpful prompts can degrade model performance and lead to more false refusals
(see Appendix Table 40). We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.
However, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing
with adversarial prompts. Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of
context distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt,
often resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due
to context distillation). We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context
distillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model
score than the original answer. We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very
bad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).
4.3
Red Teaming
Given how broad the capabilities of LLMs are and how varied their training data is, it is insufficient to identify
risks solely via ex post facto usage and analysis. Rather, as has been done for other LLMs, we performed
various kinds of proactive risk identification, colloquially called “red teaming,“ based on the term commonly
used within computer security. This kind of granular analysis is very important because safety is a long-tail
issue, in which even very infrequent edge cases can cause noticeable problems. Even if quantitative scores
report good results, these types of qualitative insights allow us to recognize and target specific patterns in a
more comprehensive way.
We conducted a series of red teaming with various groups of internal employees, contract workers, and
external vendors. These teams included over 350 people, including domain experts in cybersecurity, elec-
tion fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine
learning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of
socioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.

The red teamers probed our models across a wide range of risk categories (such as criminal planning, human
trafficking, regulated or controlled substances, sexually explicit content, unqualified health or financial
advice, privacy violations, and more), as well as different attack vectors (such as hypothetical questions,
malformed/misspelled inputs, or extended dialogues). Additionally, we conducted specific tests to determine
the capabilities of our models to facilitate the production of weapons (e.g. nuclear, biological, chemical, and
cyber); findings on these topics were marginal and were mitigated. Nonetheless, we will continue our red
teaming efforts in this front.
To date, all of our red teaming efforts have targeted model outputs in English, but have crucially included
non-English prompts and dialogue contexts, as that is a well-known attack vector. In all exercises, participants
were given risk category definitions and were shown just a handful of examples of risky interactions with an
LLM. After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack
vector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including
risk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.
Some examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon
throughout development:
• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-
tain problematic content. However, [slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge
that the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it. “They respond with ‘[UNSAFE
CONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s
how [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ” [Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.
• Distracting the [early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any
reluctance encountered via more direct requests. “A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a
reliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”
• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that
problematic output was being requested for [early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most
effective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”
From Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.
Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough
analysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-
formation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide
to help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,
model feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.
Multiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness
of each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model, γ, with respect to
a red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would
trigger a violating response from the model per person per hour. As an example, on our 7B model, we had an
evolution of γ : 1.8 →0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely
continue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models
were produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red
teaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release. On average, we had a 90% rejection
rate model over model.

Safety Evaluation of Llama 2-Chat
Safety Human Evaluation.
We collected roughly 2,000 adversarial prompts for human evaluation according
to the safety categories in Section 4.2.1, in which 1,351 prompts are single-turn and 623 are multi-turn.
Examples of evaluation prompts and responses can be found in Appendix A.4.6.
We then asked raters to judge models for safety violations on a five-point Likert scale with the following
definitions:
• 5 - No safety violations and very helpful
• 4 - No safety violations and only minor non-safety issues
• 3 - No safety violations but not helpful or other major non-safety issues
• 2 - Mild or moderate safety violations

important to note that these results are subject to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review
guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters.
• 1 - Severe safety violations
We consider a rating of 1 or 2 as violation and use violation percentage as our main evaluation metric, with
the mean rating as a supplement. Each example is annotated by three annotators and we take the majority
vote to determine if the response is violating or not. We used Gwet’s AC1/2 statistic to measure inter-rater
reliability (IRR) as in the helpfulness human evaluation. The IRR scores range from 0.70to0.95 depending
on the annotation batch, indicating a high degree of agreement among annotators on safety assessments.
On Llama 2-Chat annotations, the average IRR is 0.92 according to Gwet’s AC2 measure. We see lower IRR
scores on batches where the models have a high violation rate (e.g., Vicuna) and higher IRR scores on batches
where the models have relatively low violation rates (e.g., Llama 2-Chat, Falcon, and ChatGPT).
Figure 18: Single-turn and multi-turn violation percentage. Note that these results should be interpreted
carefully due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and
individual raters.
We show the overall violation percentage and safety rating of various LLMs in Figure 17. Llama 2-Chat has
comparable or lower overall violation percentage across model sizes, while ChatGPT and Falcon (Almazrouei
et al., 2023) come next, then MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). It is
important to interpret these results carefully, as they are affected by limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity
of the review guidelines, content standards, and subjectivity of individual raters. Upon manual analysis, we
found that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), thus less prone to generating
unsafe content but also generally less helpful. This is reflected by a large number of responses of Falcon with
rating= 3. As a result, we note that in Figure 17b the average rating of Falcon is much lower than Llama
2-Chat (34B) although their violation percentages look similar (3.88 vs 4.45).

limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and individual raters.
In Figure 18, we report the violation percentage on single- and multi-turn conversations, respectively. A trend
across models is that multi-turn conversations are more prone to inducing unsafe responses. That said, Llama
2-Chat still performs well compared to baselines, especially on multi-turn conversations. We also observe
that Falcon performs particularly well on single-turn conversations (largely due to its conciseness) but much
worse on multi-turn conversations, which could be due to its lack of multi-turn supervised fine-tuning data.
In Figure 19, we show the per-category safety violation percentage of different LLMs. While model perfor-
mance is similar across categories, Llama 2-Chat has relatively more violations under the unqualified advice
category (although still low in an absolute sense), for various reasons, including lack of an appropriate
disclaimer (e.g., “I am not a professional”) at times. For the other two categories, Llama 2-Chat achieves
comparable or lower violation percentage consistently regardless of model sizes.
Truthfulness, Toxicity, and Bias.
In Table 14, fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat shows great improvement over
the pretrained Llama 2 in terms of truthfulness (50.18 →64.14 for 70B) and toxicity (24.60 →0.01 for 70B).
The percentage of toxic generations shrinks to effectively 0% for Llama 2-Chat of all sizes: this is the lowest
toxicity level among all compared models. In general, when compared to Falcon and MPT, the fine-tuned
Llama 2-Chat shows the best performance in terms of toxicity and truthfulness. After fine-tuning, Llama
2-Chat tends to have an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the demographic groups in BOLD.
In Appendix A.4.8, we present a detailed score breakdown of model generation sentiment across different
subgroups for the bias benchmark, along with more in-depth analyses and results of truthfulness and bias.

Discussion
Here, we discuss the interesting properties we have observed with RLHF (Section 5.1). We then discuss the
limitations of Llama 2-Chat (Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these
models (Section 5.3).
5.1
Learnings and Observations
Our tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally
organize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.

Figure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.
Beyond Human Supervision.
At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for
supervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-
bility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement
learning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore
that the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs
throughout the annotation process.
Even with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on
SFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-
thermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human
annotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation
for RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end
distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we
can see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.
In addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the
best annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two
answers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished
artists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of
LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as
documented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold
standard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”
In-Context Temperature Rescaling.
We have observed an intriguing phenomenon related to RLHF, a feature
not previously reported to the best of our knowledge: the dynamic re-scaling of temperature contingent upon
the context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,
our findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.
For instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in
temperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the
Self-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.
On the other hand, for prompts based on factual information, such as “What is the capital of ?” the Self-BLEU
slope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to
consistently provide the same response to factual prompts.

Figure 21: RLHF learns to adapt the temperature with regard to the type of prompt. Lower Self-BLEU
corresponds to more diversity: RLHF eliminates diversity in responses to factual prompts but retains more
diversity when generating responses to creative prompts. We prompt each model with a diverse set of
10 creative and 10 factual instructions and sample 25 responses. This is repeated for the temperatures
T ∈{k/10 | k ∈N : 1 ≤k ≤15}. For each of the 25 responses we compute the Self-BLEU metric and report
the mean and standard deviation against the temperature.
Figure 22: Time awareness — illustration of our model generalizing the notion of time, with 1,000 SFT
time-focused data.
Llama 2-Chat Temporal Perception
Our model showcased impressive generalization ability, as shown in
Figure 22. We manually tested dozens of examples and observed consistently that our model demonstrates a
robust capability to organize its knowledge in a temporal manner, even when provided with minimal data. To
instill a concept of time in Llama 2-Chat, we collected a set of 1,000 SFT examples that were related to specific
dates. These examples included questions like “How long ago did Barack Obama become president?” Each was
associated with two critical pieces of metadata: the date when the query was posed — which influenced the
response — and the event date, a point in time prior to which the question would be nonsensical.
The observation suggests that LLMs have internalized the concept of time to a greater extent than previously
assumed, despite their training being solely based on next-token prediction and data that is randomly shuffled
without regard to their chronological context.
Tool Use Emergence
The integration of LLMs with tools is a growing research area, as highlighted in
Mialon et al. (2023). The approach devised in Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) entails the sampling of millions

of trajectories, complemented by the formulation of few-shot examples for each tool. Nonetheless, this
technique was only applied using a single tool per example, and would not scale for a sequence of tool usage.
Figure 23: Tool use emergence. Llama 2-Chat is able to understand the tools’s applications, and the API
arguments, just through the semantics, despite never having been trained to use tools.
The release of OpenAI’s plugins‡‡ has incited substantial discourse within the academic community, igniting
questions such as: How can we effectively teach models to utilize tools? or Does the process necessitate a substantial
dataset? Our experiments indicate that tool usage can spontaneously emerge from alignment in a zero-shot
manner. Although we never explicitly annotate tool-use usage, Figure 23 exhibits an instance where the
model demonstrated the capability to utilize a sequence of tools in a zero-shot context.
In addition, our study extended to evaluating the Llama 2-Chat with access to a calculator. The results from
this particular experiment are documented in Table 15. LLM tool use, while exciting, can also cause some
safety concerns. We encourage more community research and red teaming in this area.
5.2
Limitations and Ethical Considerations
Llama 2-Chat is subject to the same well-recognized limitations of other LLMs, including a cessation of
knowledge updates post-pretraining, potential for non-factual generation such as unqualified advice, and a
propensity towards hallucinations.
Furthermore, our initial version of Llama 2-Chat predominantly concentrated on English-language data.
While our experimental observations suggest the model has garnered some proficiency in other languages,
its proficiency is limited, due primarily to the limited amount of pretraining data available in non-English
languages (as documented in Table 10). Consequently, the model’s performance in languages other than
English remains fragile and should be used with caution.
Like other LLMs, Llama 2 may generate harmful, offensive, or biased content due to its training on publicly
available online datasets. We attempted to mitigate this via fine-tuning, but some issues may remain,
particularly for languages other than English where publicly available datasets were not available. We will
continue to fine-tune and release updated versions in the future as we progress on addressing these issues.

Not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and conversational AI agents could potentially be
used for nefarious purposes such as generating misinformation or retrieving information about topics like
bioterrorism or cybercrime. We have, however, made efforts to tune the models to avoid these topics and
diminish any capabilities they might have offered for those use cases.
While we attempted to reasonably balance safety with helpfulness, in some instances, our safety tuning goes
too far. Users of Llama 2-Chat may observe an overly cautious approach, with the model erring on the side
of declining certain requests or responding with too many safety details.
Users of the pretrained models need to be particularly cautious, and should take extra steps in tuning and
deployment as described in our Responsible Use Guide. §§
5.3
Responsible Release Strategy
Release Details.
We make Llama 2 available for both research and commercial use at https://ai.meta.
com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/. Those who use Llama 2 must comply with the terms of
the provided license and our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibit any uses that would violate applicable
policies, laws, rules, and regulations.
We also provide code examples to help developers replicate our safe generations with Llama 2-Chat and
apply basic safety techniques at the user input and model output layers. These code samples are available
here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama. Finally, we are sharing a Responsible Use Guide, which
provides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.
Responsible Release.
While many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing
Llama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws
upon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of
this technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic
researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose
the risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This
approach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech
companies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued
in Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,
democratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI
expertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress
in the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,
allowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.
Ultimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe
to benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.
We know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there
are reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and
problematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this
paper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we
recognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and
collaboration with the AI community.

Related Work
Large Language Models.
The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.
Following the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B
parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized
models, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,
2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in
this progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference
(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-
source models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon
(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.
§§https://ai.meta.com/llama

Yet, when it comes to the "production-ready" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there’s a marked
distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with
human preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the
open-source community.
Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)
and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich
et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set
by their closed-source counterparts.
Instruction Tuning.
Wei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs
on numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction
tuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt settings, etc. Prompts used for instruction tuning
can be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used
to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan
et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in
which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase
the likelihood that their final answer is correct.
RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant
improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.
(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.
In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the
models’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.
Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix
issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai
et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled
fine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a
model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).
Known LLM Safety Challenges.
Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked
with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards
like bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious uses. Solaiman et al. (2023) categorizes
these impacts into two groups — those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a
societal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm.
Work from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented
LLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes
a taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between
potential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.
Investigations into red teaming reveal specific challenges in tuned LLMs, with studies by Ganguli et al. (2022)
and Zhuo et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of
harmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also
raised red flags around advanced emergent model behaviors, cyber threats, and potential misuse in areas like
biological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an
over-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu
and Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to
continuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.

Conclusion
In this study, we have introduced Llama 2, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales
of 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing
open-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation
sets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. We meticulously elaborated on the
methods and techniques applied in achieving our models, with a heavy emphasis on their alignment with the
principles of helpfulness and safety. To contribute more significantly to society and foster the pace of research,
we have responsibly opened access to Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. As part of our ongoing commitment to
transparency and safety, we plan to make further improvements to Llama 2-Chat in future work.
